Namespaces

-You can create name spaces and export them to other files similarly to export/ import modules
- Anythin in a namespace is only availible in the namespace
- namespace DDInerface{
    export interface Draggable {
        dragStartHandler (event: Dragevent): void
        dragEndHandler (event: Dragevent): void
    }
}
- Once a namesace is exported it then needs to be added as a reference to file that needs to use it
- /// <reference path='dd-interfaces.ts' />
- the /// is intentional an required and is not a comment
- You need to place everythin in the project in a namespace with the same name or they wont speak to each other.
- lastly, you need to go to your config file and create an outfile so that they are all compiled into 1 large file

ES6 modules

- We have used these vefore for node and express, you are able to export and import the files using modules.
- import {dragtarget, draggable} from './dd-interfaces.js'
- this is a simple solution to name spaces but this wont work on older browsers, keep that in mind
- just an important note, when using the modules you need to add .js to the end off the file names.
- Ts is smart enough to notice what you mean and when they are compiled to js it will still work fine

Webpack

- The last way is to use webpack to bundle our files together and make them easier for the user to request and load.
- If we look at the network for the refactor we cna see taht every file needs to be requrested and loaded which isnt a huge deal but can add up in larger projects
- Webpack minifies the code and bundles it into the smallest form it can.
- If is also configurable, you are able to add all kinds of useful tools and modifications to the bundle.

Webpack Setup

- npm i --save-dev
//save dev means only availible on the developer side
- webpack - basic webpack dependencies
- webpack-cli - lets us use webpack terminal commands
- typescript
- ts-loader

Config Tweaks for Webpack

- make sure target is ES6
- make sure module is es2015
- comment out root dir, since webpack finds the root
- turn on source maps, so you can read minified js
