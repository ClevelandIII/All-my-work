# Bellwork
- The biggest difference between scripting and compiled languages is the fact that one can be run automatically vs the other that can be run after complilation.

## Scripting
- Scripting languages are "interpreted at runtime" and doesnt have to be compiled.

## Compilation
- Compilation languages obviously are compiled and have their code translated. 
  - The line is somewhat blurry and vauge since compilers can translate the code very fast

## Scripting & Compilation advantages
- Scripting languages are easier to learn, are easier to edit, they are dynamic and obviously they dont need to be compiled.
- Compiled languages are faster and they need to have their code compiled into "machine code". Exe's are always consistant.
